                                Sonipat&#39;s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive Chokhi Dhani
                                Sonipat&#39;s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. The failure of Chokhi Dhani
                                Sonipat to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms and conditions shall not
                                constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The section headings and subheadings contained in
                                this Agreement are included for convenience only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms
                                of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the Indian laws. This
                                Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Chokhi Dhani Sonipat and you with respect to
                                the subject matter hereof.</li>
